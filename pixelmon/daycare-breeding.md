# Daycare/Breeding

Most info you may require regarding breeding can be found on the [Pixelmon Wiki](https://pixelmonmod.com/wiki/Breeding).\
\
Notable changes from the above:

### Hidden Abilities

* Hidden Abilities will not pass down to an egg unless the breeder is the OT of both parent Pokémon.

### Daycare Requirements

* Requirements will dynamically change based on the total IV percentage of the parent Pokémon you put into a Daycare box, so they will become harder to breed as they increase in power. In some cases this may mean requirements being added to the original set, or they might be replaced entirely with new items such as [Type Gems](https://pixelmonmod.com/wiki/Gems)!&#x20;
  * In addition to normal sources of drops, you can also get more Type Gems from Gem Bags which can be obtained from various sources such as the Vote Crate or Daily Quests.
