# Base Pixelmon Changes

#### Daycare Breeding

The majority of the breeding system is unchanged, and most info you may require can be found here: [https://pixelmonmod.com/wiki/Breeding](https://pixelmonmod.com/wiki/Breeding)

Notable changes from the above:

* Hidden Abilities will not pass down to an egg unless both Pokémon's parents are the OT of the breeder.

#### External Damage

Pokémon will not take damage from external sources such as suffocating, drowning, lava, fire, or any other source of damage other than being in-battle (or falling into the void). We have done this so that you will not run into situations for example where a Legendary Pokémon that spawned near you ends up wandering into the ocean and drowning before you have a chance to catch it, or a Pokémon spawns in a cave and runs into a lava pool.
