# Base Pixelmon Changes

#### External Damage

Pokémon will not take damage from external sources such as suffocating, drowning, lava, fire, or any other source of damage other than being in-battle (or falling into the void). We have done this so that you will not run into situations for example where a Legendary Pokémon that spawned near you ends up wandering into the ocean and drowning before you have a chance to catch it, or a Pokémon spawns in a cave and runs into a lava pool.

## Daycare/Breeding

The majority of the breeding system is unchanged, and most info you may require can be found here: [https://pixelmonmod.com/wiki/Breeding](https://pixelmonmod.com/wiki/Breeding)\
\
Notable changes from the above:

#### Hidden Abilities

* Hidden Abilities will not pass down to an egg unless both Pokémon's parents are the OT of the breeder.

#### Daycare Requirements

* Requirements will dynamically change based on the total IV percentage of the parent Pokémon you put into a Daycare box, so they will become harder to breed as they increase in power. In some cases this may mean requirements being added to the original set, or they might be replaced entirely with new items such as [Type Gems](https://pixelmonmod.com/wiki/Gems)!&#x20;
