# Pixelmon Breeding

The majority of the breeding system is unchanged, and most info you may require can be found here: [https://pixelmonmod.com/wiki/Breeding](https://pixelmonmod.com/wiki/Breeding)

Notable changes from the above:

* Hidden Abilities will not pass down to an egg unless both Pok√©mon's parents are the OT of the breeder.
