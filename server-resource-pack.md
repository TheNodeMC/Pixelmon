# Server Resource Pack

The first time you join our server you will be prompted to accept the download of a Resource Pack. You must click "Accept" on this screen, or you will be kicked from the server. The Resource Pack is a required part of TheNodeMC's Pixelmon experience, and you will not be able to join without it. If you need assistance with enabling the Resource Pack, please continue reading below.

### Enabling Server Resource Packs

If you are not prompted to enable the Resource Pack the first time you join our server, follow the steps below.

1. Go to your Multiplayer server list, click on TheNodeMC, and click on the "Edit" button at the bottom of the screen.
2. Find the "Server Resource Packs:" button, and toggle it to **"Enabled"**
3. Join the server again! The Resource Pack will now download and be kept up to date automatically!

### Custom Modpack (Coming Soon)

If you're having issues with the Server Resource Pack feature or would like to take advantage of faster loading times and customized menu features you can download our Technic Modpack! You'll also be rewarded with the free \[Gamer] Title in-game!
